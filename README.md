# alzheimersclock
Javascript Alzheimer's clock (indicates whether it is day or night.)

My parents have Alzheimer's or similar dementia and they have a computer in their living room with a large screen, so, I made a Javascript Alheimer's clock for them.

# What is an Alzheimer's clock?
An Alzheimer's clock displays time and date in a large font and also gives a clear indication of whether it is night or day. My parents sometimes wake in the night, look at a clock, and don't know whether it is 3 o'clock in the morning or in the afternoon. 

# Usage
I make this their home page (served from their local file system) and have a browser start when the computer boots, so, this is effectively always on their screen.

My parents found it useful, so I'm posting this for others.

And of course it could be made better in many ways. I did have some nice images and I was putting an image with a moonscape on the "night" background and flowers and sun in a blue sky on the "day" background, but, that was too much stimulation for my parents, thus this very basic version.

Note that if you try this out, it updates every 30 seconds, and there is a long pause before anything comes up on the screen.
